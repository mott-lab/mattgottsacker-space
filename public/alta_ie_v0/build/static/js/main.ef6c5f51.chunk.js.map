    <h3>2020-05-29</h3>\n      <p>\n        I found a weird data stream on the Internet. Well, I'm not sure if \"on the Internet\" is the way to describe it. There's this antenna that my friend Don and I have been tinkering with for a while. We started out wanting to understand how signals work at a low level. My friend built the thing (I'm not much of a hardware guy), and we work together on the signal processing. A few days ago, we started picking up some signals that we haven't seen documented before. We haven't been able to trace their physical emitter. We are still novices when it comes to those particular network measurements, though, so maybe someone who is better at that stuff can figure it out. I'm just going to focus on the data itself for now and for the foreseeable future.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The signal form isn't like anything we have seen before...I guess that isn't saying much because we are hardly signal processing experts, but some googling tells us it also isn't like anything the Internet has seen before. It looks weird to us at a ~fundamental~ level. It seems like it isn't binary...we can't find an existing protocol to code the raw data into just ones and zeroes--at least, not yet. It's completely functional? I'm not sure if that's the right word for it. I'm still searching for a way to describe the form of information we are sensing. \n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <hr />\n      <h3>2020-06-09</h3>\n      <p>\n        Okay, we've managed to throw together a protocol to interpret these signals. It does not feel like a very robust protocol, but Don seems to think it will hold up. He did most of the work on it, so I trust him. This protocol is like a lens into this underlying signal, right?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I'm just having a hard time coming to terms with what this lens is revealing. \n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <hr />\n      <h3>2020-06-11</h3>\n      <p>\n        We haven't gotten anywhere useful with this data. I think I am spiraling out of reality the more I keep this between just the two of us. Don thinks I am insane for doing this, but I wanted to publish the data (alongside these personal journal entries) on the Internet in the hopes that someone else can provide some insight or at least share my fascination. \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The data seems like it is a set of files on someone's computer. It's always changing and feels like the computer itself could crash, but it also feels beautifully stable. I have been able to open a connection to the source through an emulated computer terminal. It's not a complete terminal by any means, but thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/rohanchandra/react-terminal-component/\">rohanchandra</a>, I was able to spin up a simple version pretty quickly. It feels like the purest way to share this information right now. It doesn't look like a pretty squarespace website, but it is certainly not supposed to because it is mostly log files. All will be left as plaintext, but I might add some higher level enrichment to the data over time as this thing develops. You'll see when you access the files.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        All the data is timestamped, and it aligns with present days and times. But here's the thing: the year is stamped 64 years from now.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I think I found a wormhole that opens to some future slice of spacetime. I don't know how I found it, but I am trying to find out what I can do with it. Other people are going to have to find out how I got to it, where it physically is, whose it is, etc. All that isn't my specialty. I'm more on the human/software side.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I know it's crazy. Just pick up the data. It might become clearer if you start working with it. More than anything, I want someone to convince me that this is not what I think it is.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It's like we can open an SSH tunnel into the future. Maybe the other terminal is in a location around me, maybe it's not. Thinking about what physical location means when trying to consider the time dimension is a bit too much for me right now, so I'll leave it at that.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If you've used a computer command line application before, you will be able to figure things out quickly and will likely be disappointed by the lack of terminal features you're used to (sorry).

I've always thought that \"safemode\" denomination is a little...off. How can someone feel safe in safemode? \n\nSecurity work is done for now. It looked like those fancy linguistic features all have some interaction with the internet, and they are useless without a connection. I was able to load in some custom AI models I had lying around from the early days of ALTA development--before it was even called an ALTA. My team made some that work really quite well and should meet my needs. After all, I'm not trying to talk to anyone or anything with this device. So, those models are all saved locally.\n\nI updated the repo release to be v0.1.
