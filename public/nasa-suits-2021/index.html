          Purpose
        </h3>
        <p>
          First, we will learn about the <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm">NASA SUITS program</a>, a competition at the university level for designing and prototyping spacesuit user interfaces of the future. The program is particularly focused on using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality (AR)</a> to address various needs associated with exploring the moon. NASA is planning to send astronauts to the moon in 2024 as part of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">Project Artemis!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also explore AR and the closely related technology known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">Virtual Reality (VR)</a>. You can think of AR as adding virtual objects to the physical world (like Pokemon Go), and VR as completely replacing your perception of the physical world with a virtual one. The virtual may or may not appear or behave according to how we think things ought to on Earth. For example, in VR, you can simulate and manipulate different physical laws, such as gravity. We can refer to either of these technologies (and everything in between) as XR, where the 'X' acts as a variable for any kind of reality modifier. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOKJDCqvvMk">This video</a> gives a nice overview of this tech and shows some good examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          This workshop's overall purpose is to use what we learn about XR technologies to brainstorm ideas for what the future of space exploration could look like (and have fun doing it :-).
        </p>
        <p>
          The motivations described by NASA SUITS:

          <span class="emph">For exploration</span>, it is essential that <span class="emph">crewmembers on spacewalks</span> are equipped with the appropriate <span class="emph">human-autonomy enabling technologies</span> necessary for the elevated demands of <span class="emph">lunar surface exploration</span> and <span class="emph">extreme terrestrial access</span>.

          Brainstorming Activity

        <p>
          <span class="emph">Big Question:</span> What are some ways we can use and create AR/MR/VR technologies to support space exploration?

          General working process: 
          <ol>
            <li>Identify challenges</li>
            <li>Brainstorm solutions</li>
            <li>Iterate</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible parts of your workflow:
          <ul>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>Ask questions</li>
            <li>Sketch</li>
            <li>Outline</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind the special capabilities of XR technologies, especially compared to traditional 2D displays. Some of these include:
          <ul>
            <li>Spatial cognition: Interacting in a 3D space works differently in your brain. There are many cases in which this is an advantage!</li>
            <li>Manipulation and motion: XR supports many dimensions of movement, which can allow users to perform some interactions not possible in a 2D space.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
